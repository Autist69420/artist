# A Rather Tremendous Item SysTem
Artist is an inventory mangement system powered by [Plethora][plethora]. using
CC:Tweaked's (or CCTweaks) wired network extensions.

One could think of it as a poor-man's AE network. It offers an easy way to store
and extract items, but powered entirely through ComputerCraft and peripheral
mods.

## Features
 - Index an arbitrary number of inventories (chests, barrel, crates, etc...),
   allowing for insertion and extraction from them.
 - Simple interface to view and request items.
 - Furnace mangement support, able to automatically refuel furnaces and insert
   smelted items into the main system.
 - Caching of item information, allowing for speedier startup.

It should be noted that this is not the only item system out there, nor is it
necessarily the best. You should also check out [these][turtlegistics]
[two][roger]. One notable missing feature is the ability to run multiple
instances on the same set of chests.
